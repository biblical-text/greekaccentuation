# greekaccentuation Go Module

The `greekaccentuation` go module is a direct port of the python project
https://github.com/jtauber/greek-accentuation This is still a work in progress.
I will add documentation once the project is in a more complete state.

# Design

For now, the principle of this project is to be a rough/approximate file-for-file and function-for-function equivalent
between this Go project and the Pythong project. This project is not designed to be idiomatic Go. This is
to make it easier to maintain a like-for-like match in functionality.
